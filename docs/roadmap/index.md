We do not have a public roadmap at this time. Stay tuned for updates or ask specific questions [in our Telegram group](https://t.me/hyle_org).

## Currently Supported Proving Schemes

Check the detailed [list of the proving schemes](../developers/general-doc/supported-proving-schemes.md) we currently support and the ones we'll work on next.

## Testnet

We will release our testnet in early 2025.

While we’re working towards launching the testnet, you can get hands-on right now:  
- [Explore our public devnet](../developers/using-the-cli/connect-to-devnet.md), which is live and ready for use.  
- Or, [spin up your own instance](../developers/using-the-cli/run-devnet.md) to start building today!
