# Pipelined proving

## The problem: base state conflicts

The Hylé base layer ensures both privacy and scalability by verifying only the state transitions of smart contracts, rather than re-executing them. This approach reduces computational overhead but introduces a critical issue for provable applications: base state conflicts.

An app with a lot of usage will see conflicting operations, where multiple transactions reference the same base state, waiting for the previous state change to be settled.

The time spent generating proofs delays transaction finality. Proofs require accurate timestamps, but users can't predict when their transaction will be sequenced.

This causes parallelization limits: multiple transactions may reference the same base state, creating invalid proofs when one is settled before the other.

We solve these issues by splitting sequencing from settlement; an operation includes two transactions.

## Blob- and proof-transactions

To address base state conflicts, Hylé splits operations into two transactions:

1. **Blob-transaction**: outlines a state change for sequencing.
2. **Proof-transaction**: provides a proof of the state change for settlement.

From Hylé’s perspective, the blob-transaction's content does not matter: it simply represents incoming information that your contract will process. For a developer, **sequencing** provides you with a fixed order and timestamp before proving begins. Once the transactions are sequenced, the provers can easily know upon which state they should base their proof. As a developer, you can also decide on how much information is disclosed in your blob-transaction: this is app-specific.

**Settlement** happens when the corresponding proof transaction is verified and added to a block. During settlement, unproven blob transactions linked to the contract are executed in their sequencing order.

Alice sends her TX A blob, which updates the token's virtual state; a bit later, Bob sends a TX B blob which is sequenced. The updated state will now be used as the start state for the TX B proof, while Alice can prepare to send her TX A proof. This updates the token's state for TX A, then for TX B.](../assets/img/pipelined-proving.jpg)

This separation solves all three issues shown above. The blob transaction immediately reserves a place in execution order, allowing proof generation to run without blocking other transactions. The sequencing provides an immutable timestamp, so provers know which base state to use when generating proofs and can parallelize actions.

## Unprovable transactions

Even with pipelined proving, sequenced transactions that never settle can slow down the network.

To remove this risk, Hylé enforces **timeouts** for blob transactions.

Each blob transaction is assigned a specific time limit for the associated proof to be submitted and verified. Subsequent transactions can proceed without waiting indefinitely.

## Failed transactions

If the proof isn't submitted before timeout, or if the submitted proof is invalid, the transaction is included in the block, marked as Rejected, and is ignored for state updates.

The inclusion of the unproven transaction in the block ensures transparency, as the transaction data remains accessible.

![A graph with Alice, Bob, and the contract state, as above. Alice's proof transaction fails, meaning that the state of the contract removed the virtual states for Alice and Bob's transactions and creates a new virtual state with only Bob's transaction: this is what Bob can prove now to update the final asset.](../assets/img/pipelined-proving-fail.jpg)
