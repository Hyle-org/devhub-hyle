# Release notes

Read our [full changelogs on GitHub](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/releases/) or the short versions [in our Telegram group](https://t.me/hyle_org).

## 2025-02-24 − v0.12.0

### Release

🗞️ Our news:

- All examples [have been updated to v0.11.0](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/releases/tag/v0.11.0)
- We’ve added Metamask authentication to our demo AMM, [Hyleoof](https://blog.hyle.eu/introducing-hyleoof/). We’re looking forward to making the demo fully public!

💥 Breaking changes:

We heard your feedback on our **frequent breaking changes**. Going forward, we’ll be making fewer releases, relying instead on `rc` versions, so that breaking changes are batched. We’ll also include a migration guide for new releases on GitHub and in our docs.

- Contract input now uses state instead of state digest, which simplifies the API.
- SP1 verifier is now a separate feature: this drastically shortens build time if you’re not using it.
- We’ve improved the general structure of smart contracts.

✨ New features:

- We have [a JS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyle) now!

🚅 Improvements:

- Added caching for computed hash, which doubles performance in heavy load situations
- Other big performance improvements for in-memory storage

🛠️ No longer broken:

- Added missing data proposal hashes in blocks
- Fixed blob proof output index logic at settlement stage

📚 Documentation:

- Added explanations to our [proof composition concept page](https://docs.hyle.eu/concepts/proof-composability/)

### Migration guide

## 2025-02-14 − v0.11.0

✨ New features:

- Added Mempool status event `data proposal created`
- When a parent transaction times out, the timeout window for the child transactions is reset

🚅 Improvements:

- Bumped risc0 from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3 and sp1 from 4.0.1 to 4.1.1
- Improved several logs, making them more specific or adding context to them, especially on error logs
- Improved storage to make it more compact

🛠️ No longer broken:

- The Mempool status event `wait dissemination` now works for the first data proposal (genesis)
- The indexer client now gets blobs’ endpoints
- Fixed the input encoding for the bonsai runner

📚 Documentation:

- Revamped homepage and in-docs navigation
- Made some improvements for clarity to [our pipelined proving concept page](../concepts/pipelined-proving.md)
- Added a page on [proof generation and submission](../concepts/proof-generation.md)

## 2025-02-07 − v0.10.0

💥 Breaking change: we’ve replaced our serialization standard, bincode, with borsh. Encoding BlobData from JS didn’t work properly with bincode: borsh offers better support and opens new possibilities!

✨ New features:

- Introduced an indexer endpoint that adds events to BlobTXs: if your transaction didn’t settle, you can now debug its flow much more easily!
- Introduced fees in ConsensusProposal. This has no external impact at this time.
- Added Mempool status event `waiting_dissemination`

🛠️ No longer broken:

- Hyllar Indexer now computes the correct caller in proof composition cases.
- Fixed a bug where the client couldn’t close the websocket.

## 2025-02-03 − v0.9.0

💥 Breaking changes:

- Added transactions context (block, timestamp, …) to proofs for more flexibility

✨ New features:

- You can now start a node with an indexer and postgres database simply with `cargo run -- --pg`
- Added an endpoint for contract registration

🚅 Improvements:

- Updated risc0 to 1.2.2
- Made logging less spammy and more informative (incl. logging timeouts as info)
- Improved the transaction builder tool in the SDK

🛠️ No longer broken:

- Contract state indexers are now fully saved upon restart
- Staking contracts now check that there is a `transfer` blob
- The Rust version enforced in cargo is less restrictive

📚 Documentation:

- Updated [our examples](https://github.com/Hyle-org/examples) so they work with 0.9.0!
- Added OpenAPI documentation on contract state indexers
- Added a swagger for the node and its indexer

Quick note: release notes will be published on Fridays instead of Mondays from now on. See you in just a few days!

## 2025-01-27 − v0.8.0

💥 Breaking changes:

- Hyle-contracts: Merged the contracts ‘metadata’ feature into ‘client’
- There are no more `RegisterContract` transactions: contracts are now registered with `BlobTransactions`, like everything else.
- Contract registration has been reworked using proof outputs; we introduced UUID contract names ([see uuid-tld](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/88ba05b5da901e13ff2fb3620c23a64f8cc44093/crates/contracts/uuid-tld) for an example).
- Removed `hyled` and `hyrun`. If you were using them, check out our SDK instead.

✨New features:

- You can now settle transactions that have a proof of failure before they timeout
- Made progress on the implementation of our consensus

🚅 Improvements:

- We now enforce a recent Rust version to avoid errors.

🛠️ No longer broken:

- Bug fixes include Dockerfile, environment variables, and identities.

📚 Documentation:

- Our [SDK has a README](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/crates/contract-sdk) now!
