Title: Grants
---

We have a grant program supporting developers who want to work on [trust infrastructure](https://gestalt.cafe/trust-infrastructure/) and programmable cryptography on Hylé.

## What are our grants like?

- You apply with an original idea or an idea from the list on our repo.
- We fund your project. You get some money upfront, so you can build without financial worries, and the rest upon completion of the project.
- You meet regularly with our CEO for guidance and to help you refine your ideas.
- You are in a Telegram group with our other grantees to share ideas and solutions.
- Our tech team supports you via Telegram and in meetings.
- Our business team helps you showcase your idea through external speaking opportunities, co-marketing, and other assets.
