## Testnet

We are on our way to launch a **private testnet in Q2 2025**, which will be followed by a public testnet.

Stay tuned for updates or ask specific questions [in our Telegram group](https://t.me/hyle_org).

While weâ€™re working, you can get hands-on right now:

- [Explore our public devnet or spin up your own instance](../quickstart/devnet.md) to start building today!
- [Read our release notes for the devnet](./release-notes.md).
- If you are an individual, join us [for ODBoost weeks](https://app.onlydust.com/p/hyl).
