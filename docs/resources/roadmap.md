<!-- TODO: Push the team to provide a roadmap. -->

We do not have a public roadmap at this time. Stay tuned for updates or ask specific questions [in our Telegram group](https://t.me/hyle_org).

## Testnet

We will release our testnet in Q1 2025.
<!-- What will we be able to do that we currently aren't? -->

While weâ€™re working towards launching the testnet, you can get hands-on right now:

- [Explore our public devnet or spin up your own instance](../developers/quickstart/devnet.md) to start building today!
- [Read our release notes for the devnet](./release-notes.md).

## Proving schemes

Check the [list of the proving schemes](../developers/general-doc/supported-proving-schemes.md) we currently support and the ones we'll work on next.
