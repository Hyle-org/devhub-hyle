# Roadmap

Stay tuned for updates or ask specific questions [in our Telegram group](https://t.me/hyle_org).

## What to expect in 2025

We will release our **testnet** in Q2 2025. Parallel to this, we will start implementing more QA & tooling solutions, as well as build our discovery team.

In S2 2025, we will perform audits and rollout apps made by the Discovery team.

## What do to now

While weâ€™re working towards launching the testnet, you can get hands-on right now:

- [Explore our public devnet or spin up your own instance](../developers/quickstart/devnet.md) to start building today!
- [Read our release notes for the devnet](./release-notes.md).
