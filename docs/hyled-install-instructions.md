# CLI Installation instructions

The simplest way to interact with Hylé is using `hyled`, the cosmos-SDK powered CLI.

Simply clone the [Hylé repository](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle) and install it.

## Mac, Linux, Windows with WSL

You will need to have installed `make` and `go`, v1.20 and above, on your system

Here are the commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle.git
cd hyle
make build # or make install
```

You can then get a list of commands with `hyled help`.
