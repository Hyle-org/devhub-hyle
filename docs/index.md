# Welcome to the Hylé developer docs

!!! note
    This developer portal and the project itself are still in early development. See below on how to reach out to us if you need anything that isn't here.

[Hylé](https://www.hyle.eu/) is your minimal layer one, focused only on verifying zero-knowledge proofs.


## Understanding Hylé

**Hylé** is a blockchain focused on verifying all types of zero knowledge proofs, enabling fast, cheap settlement.

Hylé separates execution, settlement and storage to give you **maximal flexibility**. You can execute your smart contracts off-chain anywhere you like, on a rollup, on-premise or even client-side. You can store your data securely in your backend, IPFS, Arweave or any other long-term solution: Hylé provides the verifiable source of truth for your end user.

With Hylé, you can build permissionless zk-applications and still decide if you make your data public or if you keep it private. On top of that, Hylé verifies all zero-knowledge proofs, so you can choose your proving scheme, your language, your prover, and still get instant finality and enhanced security.

Hylé comes with identity abstraction, making it easy and seamless to manage all account types: EOA, smart wallets, and more. Better yet, our native Name System is much more human-friendly than the usual raw hexadecimal addresses. Hylé addresses can be made of multiple parts, enabling bridgeless cross-chain composability down the line.
