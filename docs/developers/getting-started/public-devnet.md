# Public devnet

Hylé provides a public devnet where you can test your smart contract and help us test our network.

If you want a more stable version, we encourage you to [run your own devnet](run-devnet.md).

## Built-in contracts

Default nodes include the [following contracts](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/contracts):
- `hydentity`: Basic identity provider
- `hyllar`: Simple ERC20-like contract
- `amm`: Simple AMM contract
