# Examples

Detailed examples of Hylé-based applications.

## Sample contracts in Hylé

We have Hylé-made Risc0 smart contracts :

* [`hydentity`](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/contracts/hydentity): Basic identity provider
* [`hyllar`](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/contracts/hyllar): Simple ERC20-like contract
* [`risc0 recursion`](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/contracts/risc0-recursion)
* WIP: [`staking`](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/contracts/staking)

There is also a CLI called [`hyrun`](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/crates/hyrun) to execute those contracts, generate proofs, etc.

## Code examples

* [Collatz example on Hylé](https://github.com/Hyle-org/examples/blob/main/README.md), using SP1, Noir, or Groth16

## Demos and provable apps

Demos:

* [Vibe Check](https://blog.hyle.eu/introducing-vibe-check/): a zkML app.
* [Hyleoof](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyleoof): an AMM.

[Our grantees](../../resources/grants.md) have worked on Hylé-based projects. Check them out for inspiration on building provable apps!
