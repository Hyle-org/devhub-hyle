# Examples

Detailed examples of Hylé-based applications.

## Demos

* [Vibe Check](vibe-check.md): a zkML app.

## Code examples

Hylé does not have a native execution environment. Smart contracts do not execute code on Hylé, they describe a verification logic for a particular program.

* [Collatz example on Hylé](https://github.com/Hyle-org/examples/blob/main/README.md), using SP1, Noir, or Groth16
* [Hyleoof](./amm.md): an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based on Hylé.

## Provable apps

[Our grantees](../../resources/grants.md) have worked on a few projects that don't yet leverage Hylé. They can provide you with inspiration on provable apps.

- [Provable play-by-email games engine](https://github.com/MatteoMer/provable-email-game-engine): A framework for building provable turn-based games, including zkChess.
