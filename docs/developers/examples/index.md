# Examples

Detailed examples of Hylé-based applications.

## Sample contracts in Hylé

We have three Hylé-made Risc0 smart contracts :

* [`hydentity`](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/contracts/hydentity): Basic identity provider
* [`hyllar`](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/contracts/hyllar): Simple ERC20-like contract
* [`amm`](amm.md): Simple AMM contract

There is also a tool called `[hyrun](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/crates/hyrun)` to execute those contracts, generate proofs, etc.

## Code examples

* [Collatz example on Hylé](https://github.com/Hyle-org/examples/blob/main/README.md), using SP1, Noir, or Groth16

## Demos and provable apps

[Our grantees](../../resources/grants.md) have worked on a few projects that don't yet leverage Hylé. Check them out for inspiration on building provable apps!

* [Vibe Check](vibe-check.md): a zkML app.
* [Provable play-by-email games engine](https://github.com/MatteoMer/provable-email-game-engine): A framework for building provable turn-based games, including zkChess.
