## Supported proving schemes

Hylé currently supports the following zero-knowledge proving schemes:

- [Risc0](https://risc0.com/docs/)
- [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/introduction)

## Planned future support

We plan to eventually support all major proving schemes.

The next proving schemes we're aiming to support are:

- [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/) via Stwo
- [Groth16](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/groth16)
- [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/docs/)
