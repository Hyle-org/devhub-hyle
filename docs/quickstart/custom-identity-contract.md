# Using a custom identity contract

## When to use identity contracts on Hyl√©

On Hyl√©, any smart contract can serve as proof of identity. This flexibility allows you to register your preferred identity source as a smart contract for account identification. Hyl√© also ships [a native `hydentity` contract](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/crates/contracts/hydentity) for simplicity.

This guide walks you through creating and deploying your first simple identity contract using Hyl√© and RISC Zero. We'll use [our simple identity example](https://github.com/Hyle-org/examples/tree/main/simple-identity), which mirrors our [simple token transfer example](./your-first-smart-contract.md).

For a deeper understanding of smart contracts, explore our [identity management documentation](../concepts/identity.md).

## Run the example

!!! warning
    Our examples work on Hyl√© v0.7.2. Subsequent versions introduce breaking changes which have not yet been reflected in our examples.

!!! info
    You can jump to [Code Snippets](#code-snippets) for an in-depth look at the contract.

### Prerequisites

- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (you'll need `rustup` and Cargo).
- Install openssl-dev (e.g. `apt install openssl-dev` or `cargo add openssl`).
- For our example, [install RISC Zero](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install).
- [Start a single-node devnet](./devnet.md). We recommend using [dev-mode](https://dev.risczero.com/api/generating-proofs/dev-mode) with `-e RISC0_DEV_MODE=1` for faster iterations during development.

### Build and register the identity contract

To build all methods and register the smart contract on the local node [from the source](https://github.com/Hyle-org/examples/blob/main/simple-identity/host/src/main.rs), from the cloned Examples folder, run:

```bash
cargo run -- register-contract
```

The expected output is `üìù Registering new contract simple_identity`.

### Register an account / Sign up

To register an account with a username (`alice`) and password (`abc123`), execute:

```sh
cargo run -- register-identity alice.simple_identity abc123
```

The node's logs will display:

```bash
INFO hyle::data_availability::node_state::verifiers: ‚úÖ Risc0 proof verified.
INFO hyle::data_availability::node_state::verifiers: üîé Program outputs: Successfully registered identity for account: alice.simple_identity
```

### Verify identity / Login

To verify `alice`'s identity:

```bash
cargo run -- verify-identity alice.simple_identity abc123 0
```

This command will:

1. Send a blob transaction to verify `alice`'s identity.
1. Generate a ZK proof of that identity. It will only be valid once, thus the inclusion of a nonce.
1. Send the proof to the devnet.

Upon reception of the proof, the node will:

1. Verify the proof.
1. Settle the blob transaction.
1. Update the contract's state.

The node's logs will display:

```bash
INFO hyle::data_availability::node_state::verifiers: ‚úÖ Risc0 proof verified.
INFO hyle::data_availability::node_state::verifiers: üîé Program outputs: Identity verified for account: alice.simple_identity
```

See your contract's state digest at: `https://hyleou.hyle.eu/contract/$CONTRACT_NAME`.

See your transaction on Hyl√©'s explorer: `https://hyleou.hyle.eu/tx/$TX_HASH`.

## Development mode

We recommend activating [dev-mode](https://dev.risczero.com/api/generating-proofs/dev-mode) during your early development phase for faster iteration upon code changes with `-e RISC0_DEV_MODE=1`.

You may also want to get insights into the execution statistics of your project: add the environment variable `RUST_LOG="[executor]=info"` before running your project.

The full command to run your project in development mode while getting execution statistics is:

```bash
RUST_LOG="[executor]=info" RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run
```

### Registering the contract

This part is the same as for [Your first smart contract](./your-first-smart-contract.md).

### Register an identity

#### Build the blob transaction

This is a simplified code snippet:

```rs
let action = RegisterIdentity {
    account: identity,
};
let blob = sdk::Blob {
    contract_name: contract_name,
    data: action.as_blob_data(), // Note: This function does not exist. Used here for clarity
};
let blob_tx = BlobTransaction {
    identity: identity,
    blobs: vec![blob],
};
```

You can compare these to the fields described in the [Transactions on Hyl√©](../concepts/transaction.md) page.

#### Prove the registration

##### On the backend side

(The backend is called "host" in Risc0.)

Hyl√© transactions are settled in two steps, following [pipelined proving principles](../concepts/pipelined-proving.md). After sending the blob, your transaction is sequenced, but not settled.

For the transaction to be settled, it needs to be proven. You'll start with building the contract input, specifying:

- the initial state
- the identity of the transaction initiator
- the transaction hash, which can be found in the explorer after sequencing
- information about the blobs.
  - The password as a private input for proof generation in `private_blob`
  - `blobs`: full list of blobs in the transaction (must match the blob transaction)
  - `index`: each blob of a transaction must be proven separately for now, so you need to specify the index of the blob you're proving.

```rs
// Build the contract input
let inputs = ContractInput {
    initial_state: initial_state.as_digest(),
    identity: blob_tx.identity,
    tx_hash: blob_tx_hash,
    private_blob: sdk::BlobData(password),
    blobs: blobs,
    index: sdk::BlobIndex(0),
};

```

##### On the contract side

(The contract is called "guest" in Risc0.)

These inputs are then used by the sdk to [initialize the contract](https://github.com/Hyle-org/examples/blob/main/simple-identity/methods/guest/src/main.rs#L8) :

```rust
    // Parse contract inputs
    let (input, action) = sdk::guest::init_raw::<IdentityAction>();
```

- The **input** variable is the above constructed **ContractInput**
- The **action** contains the `let action RegisterIdentity { account: identity };` defined in the blob.

The password is retrieved by the guest:

```rust
    // Extract private information
    let password = from_utf8(&input.private_blob.0).unwrap();
```

The action is then handled by the contract:

```rust
    // We clone the inital state to be updated
    let mut next_state: Identity = input.initial_state.clone();

    // Execute the given action
    let res = sdk::identity_provider::execute_action(&mut next_state, action, password);
```

And the contract then commits the new state:

```rust
    sdk::guest::commit(input, next_state, res);
```

The `guest::commit` function includes the `HyleOutput` as explained in [Transactions on Hyl√©](../concepts/transaction.md).

### Verify an identity

The process is the same as for registering a new identity, but the action is different:

```rs

let action = VerifyIdentity {
    account: identity,
    nonce,
};
```
